# Welcome to UW Deep Blue
We're an undergraduate design team from the University of Waterloo. This is our repository for all things software related for our first AUV design. We'll be mainly using ROS2, with a combination of C++ and Python depending on what makes most sense for the task at hand. 

# Onboarding

To get started with UW Deep Blue's software team, please check out our [notion page](https://www.notion.so/Software-Onboarding-WIP-c92b24ebee4b4d20bd3cd9bb785aa47d). Choose which team you more closely align with (Perception or Planning and Controls) and complete the onboarding activities for that team. 

## Repository Organization

We're intending to split up our work into three main ROS2 packages; db_perception, db_nav and db_controls. We'll also likely have a package for bring-up and diagnostics; db_system-management and db_diagnostics. 

## Code Standards

To be added!
